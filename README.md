# BitPay-Accommodation-App

### Overview
The BitPay Accommodation is a Mobile Application that WeThinkCode_ students across all campuses will use to find affordable solo studios, shared flats or homestays accommodation. The application will allow landlords, house owners and other students who are willing to accept an amount less than the full balance to advertise available accommodation to rent. The students will then be able to split their rent payment into smaller payments throughout the month or upcoming months.
